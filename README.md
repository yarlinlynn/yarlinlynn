## 🧠 Skills I'm Acquiring in My Toolbox

As a dedicated learner on the path to becoming a full-stack software developer, I’ve been gaining solid experience with:

- **Frontend Foundations:**  
  HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript ES6+, Sass  
  I enjoy crafting clean, responsive UI components that feel great to use.

- **User-Centric Design:**  
  Accessibility, semantic markup, and intuitive layouts are baked into every project.  
  I’ve built everything from pricing components to full-blown product landing pages.

- **Version Control & Collaboration:**  
  Git and GitHub workflows — branching, pull requests, commit discipline, the works.

- **Backend (In Progress):**  
  Currently exploring Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to round out my full-stack capabilities.

- **Project Planning & Reflection:**  
  Thanks to my coursework and career reflection sessions, I understand how to set short-term and long-term dev goals, document work effectively, and always keep the user in mind.
