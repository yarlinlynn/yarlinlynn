# Hey there, I’m Yarlin! 👋 

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where code meets creativity, coffee fuels progress, and bugs don’t stand a chance. I'm a proud CodeSpace student on a mission to become a full-stack web developer, one commit at a time. I love building sleek, interactive web experiences — and yes, yes, I love dark mode. 🌒


## 👩‍💻 About Me

```
const yarlin = {
  student: "CodeSpace",
  specialty: "Frontend",
  learning: ["Backend", "Fullstack"],
  goals: {
    shortTerm: "Master backend development and build full-stack apps",
    longTerm: "Work as a freelance dev creating meaningful digital experiences",
  },
  vibes: ["Focused", "Adaptable", "Always improving"],
};
```

## 🧠 Skills I'm Acquiring in My Toolbox

- **Frontend Foundations:**  
  HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
  I enjoy crafting clean, responsive UI components that feel great to use.

- **User-Centric Design:**  
  Accessibility, semantic markup, and intuitive layouts are baked into every project.  
  I’ve built everything from pricing components to full-blown product landing pages.

- **Version Control & Collaboration:**  
  Git and GitHub workflows — branching, pull requests, commit discipline, the works.

- **Backend:**  
 Explore Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to round out my full-stack capabilities.

- **Project Planning & Reflection:**  
  Thanks to my coursework and career reflection sessions, I understand how to set short-term and long-term dev goals, document work effectively, and always keep the user in mind.
